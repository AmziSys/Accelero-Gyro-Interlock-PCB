# Accelero-Gyro-Interlock-PCB

---------------------- Accelerometer-Gyroscope Sensor Interlock -----------------------

* Intro:
The project aims to control/monitor two accelerometer-gyroscope sensors using an STM32 microcontroller-based board.

(An accelerometer measures the linear acceleration of movement, and a gyroscope measures the angular velocity of rotation).

* Design: 
The main board contains:
- Blues Swan Feather-board: a low-cost, embeddable STM32L4 microcontroller designed to accelerate the development and deployment of battery-powered IoT solutions.
- Adafruit Industries 2090: a capacitive LCD touchscreen (2.8 TFT LCD w/MicroSD Socket).
- QwiicBus Endpoint: a connector to link the main board to the sensors (I2C communication bus).
- Adafruit EYESPI Breakout Board: to connect the LCD
- Safety relay, screw terminal
- Transistors, LEDs, 
- push buttons...

The board was designed using Kicad 8
